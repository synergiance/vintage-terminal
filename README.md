# Vintage Terminal
### A vintage terminal emulator

Currently, this is just a learning project, so don't expect much yet. I am using
OpenGL to create a vintage looking terminal emulator that supports fonts,
ligatures, and nice effects. I may also allow port this to Vulkan when it
becomes more prevalent.
